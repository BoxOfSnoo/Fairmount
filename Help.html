	<p><b><h3>Description</h3></b></p>

    <p>
        Fairmount is a tool that allows you to view the contents of a
        DVD as though they were normal files on a removable disk. Most
        DVDs are encrypted, and Fairmount cannot decrypt such DVDs
        directly, but it instead uses freely available software
        provided by
        <a href="http://www.videolan.org"/>VideoLan</a>
        to read the files.
        Thus, this software, which may be found at
        <a href="http://download.videolan.org/libdvdcss/last/macosx/">http://download.videolan.org/libdvdcss/last/macosx/</a>,
        must be installed for Fairmount to work.
    </p>

	<p><b><h3>Usage</h3></b></p>
	
	<p>
		Using Fairmount is easy. Just start the application, and it will
		do it's magic automatically, replacing the original DVD on the desk
		by a decrypted disc image of this DVD.

		To eject the original disc, simply eject the decrypted image.

		Upon quitting, the orignal disc will reappear.
	</p>
	
	<div align="center">
		<img id='fairmountanim' src="fairmount_frame1.png" alt="Fairmount in action" />
	</div>

	<script type="text/javascript">
		function AnimFairmount()
		{
			document.getElementById('fairmountanim').src = "fairmount_frame" + frame + ".png";
			
			if (frame == 1) timeout = 1500;
			else if (frame == 2) timeout = 2000;
			else if (frame == 7) timeout = 1000;
			else if (frame == 8) timeout = 4000;
			else timeout = 500;
			
			setTimeout(AnimFairmount, timeout);
			frame = frame + 1;
			if (frame > 8) frame = 1;
		}

		frame = 1;
		setTimeout(AnimFairmount, 1000);
	</script>
	
	<p>
		Once Fairmount is launched, making a backup of a DVD is as simple as drag
		and dropping its VIDEO_TS folder somewhere on your hard disk. The resulting
		copy will be decrypted as it is copied and will be ready for archival.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Fairmount also enables application such as
		<a href="http://www.metakine.com/products/dvdremaster/">DVDRemaster</a> to
		work directly on an encrypted DVD to make a copy that can be burnt on another
		DVD or that can be played on a video iPod.
	</p>
	
	<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
	<p><b><h3>Known problems</h3></b></p>
	
	<p>
		Fairmount adds a bit of latency to data access (the bandwidth - the speed
		at which data is accessed - is however nearly unaffected). Some applications
		such as Apple DVD Player that expects low latency access might suffer from hiccups.
		When experiencing these hiccups, you can simply quit Fairmount and use the DVD normally.

	<p><b><h3>Technical information</h3></b></p>
	
	<p>
		Fairmount source code is available and released under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">
		GPL license</a>. For the developers taking a look at the source, here is some useful
		information:
	</p>
	
	<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
	<p><b>Basic Sequence of Operations</b></p>
	
	<p>
		Fairmount manages discs inserted by the user, and
		mount an identic disc image which files are decrypted seemlessly.
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A disc is inserted by the user.</li>	
		<li>Fairmount receives a notification about the new disc.</li>
		<li>If the disc is a video dvd, the original disc is unmounted.</li>
		<li>It then starts a local web server (which is only accessible
		by the local host), to serve the decrypted image.</li>
		<li>The decrypted image is then mounted using Apple's tool (hdiutil).</li>
		<li>When the user ejects the image,
		the web server is stopped, and the original disc is ejected.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		By this process, Fairmount allows you to use an encrypted dvd as if 
		it was decrypted.
	</p>

	<p><b>Sources files overview</b></p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><i>Types.h</i>:<br />
			Specifies some data types used throughout the code.
		</li>
		
		<li><i>Decryption.[h,m]</i>:<br />
			Provides the dvdcss API. <b>dvdcss is not included with Fairmount</b>,
			it is rather loaded from the user's disk and must be separately installed.
		</li>
		
		<li><i>Fairmount.[h,mm]</i>:<br />
			This contains the main classes for Fairmount, the Fairmount class
			which registers itself with the Disk Arbitration framework to
			receive notifications of disks appearing and disappearing, and the
			DVDServer class which do the heavywork and contains the web server object.
		</li>
		
		<li><i>Overlay.[h,m]</i>:<br />
			Contains the code neccessary to show the progress's overlay Apple's style.
		</li>
		
		<li><i>socketWrap.[h,c]</i>:<br />
			Provides a simple API to hide socket usage details.
		</li>
		
		<li><i>FileSize.[h,c]</i>:<br />
			Function that provides the byte size of block devices.
		</li>
		
		<li><i>ListFiles.[h,cpp]</i>:<br />
			Provides the file's list (size, start and end) of the ISO9660 filesystem
			of the dvd. Used by CSSFileAccess to ensure decryption is only applied
			on VOB files.
		</li>
		
		<li><i>HTTPServer.[h,cpp]</i>:<br />
			A quite minimal web server able to serve large files.
		</li>
		
		<li><i>IFileAccess.h</i>:<br />
			Provides an interface to all data access done by the web server.
			By using this interfaces, it is easy to test different methods of
			accessing data.
		</li>
		
		<li><i>FileAccess.cpp</i>:<br />
			A dumb file access module used for debugging purpose.
		</li>
		
		<li><i>CSSFileAccess.cpp</i>:<br />
			This module does the decryption on the VOB files, and slices requests
			on VOB boundaries.
		</li>
		
		<li><i>CachedFileAccess.cpp</i>:<br />
			This module works on top of another to provide threaded read-ahead cache.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p><b>Working on Fairmount</b></p>
	
	<p>
		If you want to work on Fairmount, the first thing you should do is set
		the following environment variable for the executable (this is saved per user
		in XCode): name:"DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES" value:"/usr/lib/libMallocDebug.A.dylib".
		This ensures memory bugs will be found sooner.
	</p>
	
	<!-- <p>
		Bug fixes, new features, comments, better documentation, etc,
		are all welcomed and should be sent to fairmount-devel@metakine.com for integration.
