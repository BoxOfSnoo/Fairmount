# Fairmount

This is Fairmount, a tool which allows fair use of DVD content.

It is a program to allow you to mount the contents of a DVD on a
Mac OS X machine as though it was a normal file system, and examine
the contents.

It does not itself supply DVD decryption code, but instead requires
that VLC be installed and makes use of the libraries provided by it.

Fairmount was originally developed by Metakine, but it appears to have
vanished from their web site. However, it was released under the GPL,
so others may continue developing it.
